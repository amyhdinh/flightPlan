# flightPlan
flightPlan.java implements Dijkstra's Algorithm in order to find the shortest path from a given list of plane routes.
FlightdataFile.txt includes a list of times it takes to get from one city to another and costs.
PathstoCalculate.txt includes a list of cities to calculate their best paths based on time.
Program will print out the top 3 paths from the shortest time it takes to get from the starting city to the finish.
